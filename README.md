As a crowdsourcing service model in the healthcare field, medical crowdsourcing allocates tasks to large-scale professionals via edge-cloud collaborative platforms. It provides patients with health consultations and treatment plans. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to achieve fine-grained access control for medical tasks, and fine-grained identification for task requesters, along with addressing workers' selection limitation. Futhermore, current access control methods in medical crowdsourcing cannot prevent improper access to medical tasks throughout their full lifecycle, thus making them susceptible to historical and future data breaches. To this end, this paper proposes a novel attribute-based matchmaking encryption scheme called MatFBMC that simultaneously ensures both forward and backward secrecy. This scheme reduces the local overhead of key updates by outsourcing punctures to the crowdsourcing platform. Fine-grained bilateral access control is achieved through bi-directional matches of policies and attributes. Meanwhile, it ensures backward secrecy and user revocation through the tree-based revocation method. We provide security proofs for s-IND-CPA and EUF-CMA. Based on Java Pairing-Based Cryptographic Library and real-world medical datasets, simulations display better computation and storage performance compared to the state-of-art work.
